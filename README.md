## Description

<h4>What is a MacChanger?</h4>
Every networking device is assigned a MAC address by the device manufacturer which is helpful to communicate with other devices. A MAC address is hard-coded on the device and it is not possible to permanently change it. But, we can change it temporarily using a MacChanger. A MacChanger is a tool that changes the MAC address to the desired (or random) address until that device is rebooted. Once, the device is rebooted, the MAC address of that device will be set to its original MAC address.
